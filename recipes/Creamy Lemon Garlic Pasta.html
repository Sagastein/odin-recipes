      </li>
      <li>1 large bunch medium size asparagus</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>

      <li>
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) and line a baking
          sheet with foil.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p>
          Trim about 2-inches of the bottom tough ends from the asparagus spears
          and set aside. Cut remaining asparagus into 1-inch pieces. Spread out
          asparagus pieces and garbanzo beans on the prepared baking sheet.
          Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon each
          salt, pepper and garlic powder; toss well to coat.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <p>
          Roast in the preheated oven until asparagus is tender and beans are
          slightly toasted, about 20 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add
          reserved asparagus ends and cook until very tender. Remove with a
          slotted spoon and place into a food processor or blender.
        </p>
